# JavaEmailAutomation
Sends emails, without me having to bother. If you want to use this, then set all the relevant environment variables as seen in the program (on linux I do 'sudo xed ~/.bashrc'). Also at the end of the .bashrc file add a command that will run the app.jar file on startup (on linux I put 'java -jar &lt;path_to_jar>/app.jar' at the end of the .bashrc file).
